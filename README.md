This project is an AI-based transcription tool for the Albanian language. The tool is designed to automatically transcribe Albanian speech to text using Python.

## Features

- Automatic speech recognition for Albanian language with our best trained model
- User-friendly interface to label and validate speech datas
- Dataset with Albanian Speech datas.

## Installation

This project is made up of three main parts: an API that serves all the files to the UI, a section that is used to label and validate Albanian speech data, and the third part which is the model test. In the web folder are all the files needed to run the UI, in the FastAPI are the files needed to run the API, and in the automation folder are some scripts used for many things, including generating datasets. The folder training includes all the notebooks used to train the model. The project is hosted at the domain [uneduashqiperine.com](http://uneduashqiperine.com/).


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
